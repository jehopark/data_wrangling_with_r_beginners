# Use the `?` help operator to understand what the sample function does.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
?sample
```

## Using the `sample` function, create a vector named `coeffs` containing 3 integers drawn from -10 to 10 inclusively with replacement.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
coeffs <-sample(-10:10, 3, replace = TRUE)
```

# Determine the class of the vector `coeffs`.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
class(coeffs)
```

## Create variables, a, b, and c, and assign the 3 values from the vector `coeffs` respectively.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
a <- coeffs[1]
b <- coeffs[2]
c <- coeffs[3]
```

# Evaluate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is calculated as (b^2 - 4ac).
```{r}
# Write your answer here
b^2 - 4*a*c
```
